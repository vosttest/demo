        <p>
            RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. — The nuns at Zina Rodriguez’s Catholic school in the Bronx thwacked her knuckles to
            punish
            sloppy handwriting, so she was shocked when her mail-in ballot in Florida was rejected because her
            signature did
            not match the one on record with elections officials.</p>

        <p>Ms. Rodriguez, a registered Democrat, found the rejection notice in her mailbox at 7 p.m. the night before
            the
            Nov. 6 election, two hours after the deadline for appeal had passed. When she protested at the Palm Beach
            County
            Board of Elections the next morning, she learned that the culprit was a driver’s license signature, hastily
            squiggled on an electronic signature pad two years earlier.</p>

        <p>“There were 13 amendments on that ballot. The only reason I chose to write in was because I wanted time to
            research all the questions. I was fulfilling my responsibility,” said Ms. Rodriguez, 47, a behavioral
            health care
            consultant from Lake Worth, Fla. “All of that got thrown away because I wanted to get out of the D.M.V.
            office as
            fast as I can. It is incredibly upsetting.”</p>

        <p>The issue of faulty signatures, especially on mail-in ballots, has emerged as a central point of contention
            in
            the county-by-county recounts taking place in Florida, with lawsuits spinning off the 2018 election like
            tornadoes off a hurricane.
